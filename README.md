# Resilio â€“ TaskPulse

**TaskPulse** is a lightweight, cloud-native task management backend built to demonstrate modern SRE practices including infrastructure as code, GitOps, observability, and resilience engineering.

This proof-of-concept (PoC) project simulates a production-grade environment with scalable architecture, monitoring, alerting, and CI/CD automation.

## ðŸš€ Features Implemented

### âœ… FastAPI Microservice
- Lightweight task management REST API
- Health check (`/health`) and Swagger docs (`/docs`) endpoints
- Exposes Prometheus metrics at `/metrics`

### âœ… Terraform Infrastructure
- Creates GKE cluster, service accounts, networking, and persistent storage
- Secrets managed via GitHub Actions and GCP IAM

### âœ… CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Infrastructure deployed with Terraform on `[infra]` commit
- Docker image built and pushed to GCP Artifact Registry
- Helm chart used to deploy FastAPI app to GKE
- Monitoring stack deployed using `kube-prometheus-stack`
- Post-deployment tests and notifications (Slack integration)

### âœ… Monitoring & Alerting
- Prometheus collects metrics from FastAPI, Kubernetes, etc.
- Grafana dashboard auto-provisioned from config maps
- Custom Prometheus alert rules:
  - High CPU usage
  - High memory usage
  - Pod crash loops
  - Service unavailability
- Grafana exposed via LoadBalancer for public access
